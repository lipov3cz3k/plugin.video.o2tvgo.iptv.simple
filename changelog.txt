* Changing the code to only "inherit" from the original plugin and add XMLTV functionality
2017-01-20 [1.1.7] - Initial cummulative commit:
* Added basic EPG functionality for TV played directly from the plugin:
** Name and time of currently playing programme in the directory listing
** Setting of info (name, time, duration, plot, fanart, etc) for currently playing channel
** Added "CH+", "CH-", "Channel info" items to the directory listing; info loads a window containing current programme info and next 10 programmes
** Added "Refresh CH/EPG" item to directory listing: to requeue the current channel with new EPG info
* Added creation of XMLTV .XML and .M3U files based on EPG/channel info from O2TVGO
** Added "Save EPG" item to directory listing: resaves the .XML and .M3U files
** Added support for additional .XML and .M3U files - so they are parsed and relevant info is added to the .XML and .M3U files generated based on O2TVGO
